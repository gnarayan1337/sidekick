- Your API key is stored locally and securely
- No data is sent to any servers except Anthropic's API
- All processing happens in real-time, nothing is logged
- Open source for full transparency

### ⚠️ Important Security Note

This extension makes direct API calls from the browser to Claude's API using the `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header. While this works for personal use, for production applications you should:

1. **Use a backend proxy server** to keep your API key secure
2. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
3. **Add user authentication** if distributing publicly

The current implementation is suitable for personal use but exposes your API key in browser network requests. Never share your extension with your API key hardcoded.
